In 42 we dont have access to a lot of the standard C functions. But this project ask us to create our own useful library by replicating some of them and adding our own.

If you are a 42 student, know that this includes all the mandatory and bonus funcions of the project. As well as some extra functions that I've found useful to add in following projects.
